# Summary
cleanEHR is a data cleaning and wrangling platform which works with the
Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative database. It collects and
gathers high resolution longitudinal patient record from critical care units at
Cambridge, Guys/Kings/St Thomas', Imperial, Oxford, UCL Hospitals. 

The purpose of cleanEHR is to enable researchers to answer clinical questions
that are important to patients. cleanEHR is created to address various data
reliability and accessibility problems. It provides a platform that enables data
manipulation, transformation, reduction, anonymisation, cleaning and validation
with a friendly user interface which empowers non-programmers to conduct
basic data analysis by simply writing a human-readable configuration file.
